# rfDiff - GFP Protein Design with RFdiffusion

Colab notebooks for GFP protein design using RFdiffusion, created as lab exercise templates.

## Notebooks

- **GFP_Option1_MotifScaffolding.ipynb** - Motif scaffolding: fixes the GFP chromophore triad (S65-Y66-G67) and diffuses a new scaffold around it
- - **GFP_Option2_PartialDiffusion.ipynb** - Partial diffusion: noises and rebuilds the full GFP beta-barrel, preserving topology
